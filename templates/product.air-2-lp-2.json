            "title": "Can everyone use IPL?",
            "answer": "<p>IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) hair removal works by emitting intense light pulses that are absorbed by the pigment in the hair follicles. The absorbed light is then converted into heat, which targets the hair follicles and inhibits future hair growth.<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that IPL is most effective on individuals with lighter skin tones and darker hair colours. This is because the light energy is primarily absorbed by the melanin pigment in the hair. In individual's skin that's rich in melanin, the excess melanin can also absorb the light energy, leading to potential skin damage.<br\/><br\/>Similarly, IPL may not be as effective on individuals with light hair colours such as blonde, gray, or red. This is because these hair colours have less melanin content, making it challenging for the IPL device to target the hair follicles effectively.<br\/><br\/>To ensure the effectiveness and safety of IPL hair removal, we recommend users to refer to the provided skin tone chart before making a purchase.<\/p>",

            "answer": "<p>IPL, or intense pulsed light, uses strong pulses of broad-spectrum light to target hair at the root. The light is absorbed by the melanin in the hair follicle, where it is then converted into heat, resulting in thinner regrowth and eventually stopping hair growth altogether. Ulike IPL devices are CE\/UKCA cleared and offer a cost-effective, convenient solution compared to clinic laser and traditional methods of hair removal.<\/p>"

After each session, hair tends to grow back much more sparsely and thinly, leading to long-lasting hair reduction over time. To maintain smooth skin, it's recommended to perform monthly touch-ups.
