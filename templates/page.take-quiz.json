The skin in these areas is sensitive and delicate, and using an epilator may cause discomfort, irritation, or potential injury. It is important to handle such areas with care and consider alternative hair removal methods specifically designed for sensitive areas, such as using small scissors, tweezing, or consulting with a professional for specialized treatments.
