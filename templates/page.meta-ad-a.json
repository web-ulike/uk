The light is absorbed by the melanin in the hair follicle, where it is then converted into heat, resulting in thinner regrowth and eventually stopping hair growth altogether.

This is because the light energy primarily targets the melanin pigment in the hair. In individuals with darker skin tones, excess melanin in the skin can also absorb the light energy, potentially causing skin damage. Similarly, IPL might be less effective for individuals with light hair colours like blonde, gray, or red. This is due to their lower melanin content, which makes it more challenging for the IPL device to effectively target the hair follicles. For ensured effectiveness and safety of IPL hair removal, we recommend users refer to the provided skin tone chart before making a purchase.<\/p>",
