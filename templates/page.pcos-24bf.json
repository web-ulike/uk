Its effectiveness is backed by clinical studies and is FDA cleared.<\/p><p>For women with PCOS who may experience increased hair growth, IPL operates just as effectively as it does for those without PCOS. Unlike the constant cycle of shaving or other traditional hair removal methods that can cause pain or skin irritation, Ulike IPL devices offer a nearly painless and long-lasting solution for hair removal.<\/p>"
